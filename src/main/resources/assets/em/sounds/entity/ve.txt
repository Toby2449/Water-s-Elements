Hahahahaha... You have fallen into my trap foolish ones. I've got you. There is no escape. Your only choice is slave for the void.
You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into mortals! I am the enderdragon! I AM THE WITHER! I CONTROL EVERYTHING!!!!!
Become one of my mind. Now you will see what it's like to live in darkness!
I declare your souls as mine!
Sanity is forfeit!
You will not escape the darkness!
Slave to the void!
ENOUGH!!!
CONSUME!!!
Yes, become one with the void!
My purpose will put an end to your meaningless lives!
Feel the power of darkness!
No.. NO! THIS CANNOT BE THE END!
HOW CAN THIS BE? The weaklings have brought my own powers againsted myself.
Foolish mortals... I will never be defeated. I am in all of you! I AM ALL OF YOU!
